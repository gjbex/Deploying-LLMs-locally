# Agents

Agents use LLMs to perform tasks, but can also use tools to help them do so.
They can be used to automate tasks, answer questions, or perform other actions.

Framework: [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/open-source)


## What is it?

1. `environment.yml`: Conda environment file to run the script.
1. `arxiv_agent.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that implements an agent to search and
   rank ArXiv papers for a given date, and another that formats the results as an
   HTML page.  (Note: the notebook is for illustration purposes only as it
   seems to crash on a bug in iPywidgets.)
1. `arxiv_agent.py`: Python script that implements the same agent as the
   notebook, but without the iPywidgets issue.
1. `ai_research_report.html`: sample HTML report generated by the agent.


## How to use?

First, install the conda environment:

```bash 
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate ai_tools_agents
```

Next, start the ollama server:

```bash
ollama serve --model mistral
```
Then, run the agent script:

```bash
python arxiv_agent.py  --date 2025-05-30
```
