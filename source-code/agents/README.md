# Agents

Agents use LLMs to perform tasks, but can also use tools to help them do so.
They can be used to automate tasks, answer questions, or perform other actions.


## What is it?

1. `arxiv_agent.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that implements an agent to search and
   rank ArXiv papers for a given date, and another that formats the results as an
   HTML page.  (Note: the notebook is for illustration purposes only as it
   seems to crash on a bug in iPywidgets.)
1. `arxiv_agent.py`: Python script that implements the same agent as the
   notebook, but without the iPywidgets issue.
1. `environment.yml`: Conda environment file to run the script.
1. `ai_research_report.html`: sample HTML report generated by the agent.
