Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of machine learning models that have
recently gained a lot of attention.  These models are trained on large amounts
of data and after training can be used in many applications.

Although models from OpenAI and Google can be used as services online, it is
often desirable to have a model that can be used offline.  This training will
show you how to deploy and use such models locally.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * understand what LLMs are and how they are trained;
  * be able to use a pre-trained LLM for text generation;
  * be able to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for question
    answering on your own data;
  * understand how quantization works and how it can be used to reduce
    the size of a model;
  * be able to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for a specific task.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gjbex/AI-tools), as well as example code and
hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to deploy Larqe Language Models (LLMs) on
your own infrastructure.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in Python.  This is not a training that starts
from scratch.

Familiarity with Linux or HPC environments is recommented.


## Level

* Introductory: 30 %
* Intermetiate: 40 %
* Advanced: 30 %
